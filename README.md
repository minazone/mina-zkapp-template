# Mina zkApp Template

## Description

This is a project template for building zkApps (zero-knowledge applications) on the Mina Protocol. It provides a starting point for creating decentralized applications with Mina, 
leveraging PNPM as the package manager and a PNPM workspace for managing dependencies. The template integrates SnarkyJS for smart contract development and Next.js for building the web application frontend.

## Features
- [Mina Protocol](https://minaprotocol.com/): Build zkApps on the Mina blockchain, the world's lightest and most accessible blockchain.
- [PNPM Workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces): Utilize PNPM as the package manager and manage dependencies efficiently within a PNPM workspace.
- [SnarkyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkyjs): Develop smart contracts with SnarkyJS, a toolkit for writing zk-SNARK circuits in JavaScript.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Create dynamic web applications using Next.js, a popular React framework with built-in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your development machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
* [PNPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm) (v8 or higher)

## Getting Started

Click on `Use this template` to create the repo for your zkApp.

Then, to use this project template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install project dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Start the development server: `pnpm run dev`
5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.
